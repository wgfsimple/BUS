# How to contribute (Bitconch Improvement Proposal - BUSIP)

---

People wishing to submit BUSIPs, first should propose their idea or document to the issue tab. After discussion, please open a PR. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

We are fairly liberal with approving BIPs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.

Having a BIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.


# Magna Carta of Bitconch
Bitconch is dedicated to build a global community of developers. This part is still in *WIP*, please post your ideas to the issue with tag of #BUSIP
